ABOUT CRANE THEME
------------

Crane is an minimal Drupal 8 administration theme by Electric Citizen, http://www.electriccitizen.com. 

Crane uses Adminimal as its base them. 

Crane is a theme that is designed to work with Electric Citizen headless Gatsby sites that need a Drupal back-end. The base idea is to make things as clear and simple for the editor as possible.


GETTING STARTED
--------------------

Working with Crane requires a few things: 
(a) working knowledge of Sass, Twig, Jquery
(c) use of the command line (e.g. Terminal) and a good IDE (e.g. Sublime Text)

To get started:
(a) get a local site instance spun up following the virtual machine on boarding section of the site repo.
(b) Make sure you have npm installed globally and that you are using version 5.5.1 or later. You can check this by running: npm -v in any command line window.
(c) cd into the folder for crane in the command line
(d) run: npm install

Working: 
(a) cd into the crane folder in the command line
(b) run: npm start

NPM Start will trigger a gulp-based watch command that watches all Sass (.scss) files in the /scss folder and rebuilds the css and css.map files on each change.
