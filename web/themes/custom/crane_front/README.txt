ABOUT CRANE FRONT THEME
------------

Crane front is an minimal Drupal 8 front-end theme by Electric Citizen, http://www.electriccitizen.com. 

Crane uses Stable as its base them. 

Crane is a theme that is designed to work with Electric Citizen headless Gatsby sites as the most minimalistic way to style the login and other rare front-facing instances. The base idea is that since the site is headless, there should be a seamless experience between the crane front-end and that crane admin theme back-end.


GETTING STARTED
--------------------

Working with Crane Front requires a few things: 
(a) working knowledge of Sass, Twig, Jquery
(c) use of the command line (e.g. Terminal) and a good IDE (e.g. Sublime Text)

To get started:
(a) get a local site instance spun up following the virtual machine on boarding section of the site repo.
(b) Make sure you have npm installed globally and that you are using version 5.5.1 or later. You can check this by running: npm -v in any command line window.
(c) cd into the folder for crane_front in the command line
(d) run: npm install

Working: 
(a) cd into the crane_front folder in the command line
(b) run: npm start

NPM Start will trigger a gulp-based watch command that watches all Sass (.scss) files in the /scss folder and rebuilds the css and css.map files on each change.
