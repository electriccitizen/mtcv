/**
 * @file
 * Theme override to display a single page.
 *
 * The doctype, html, head and body tags are not in this template. Instead they

 * - is_admin: A flag indicating if the user has permission to access

 *
 * Site identity:
 * - front_page: The URL of the front page. Use this instead of base_path when
 *   linking to the front page. This includes the language domain or prefix.
 *
 * Page content (in order of occurrence in the default page.html.twig):
 * - messages: Status and error messages. Should be displayed prominently.
 * - node: Fully loaded node, if there is an automatically-loaded node
 *   associated with the page and the node ID is the second argument in the
 *   page's path (e.g. node/12345 and node/12345/revisions, but not
 *   comment/reply/12345).

		  				<p class="avatar-note">Sick of being an avatar? Edit your profile and add a profile pic in the user personalization area. Selfies encouraged!</p>
